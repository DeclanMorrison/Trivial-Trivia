# Trivial Trivia

### About this project :
This is a demo project used to demonstrate how `setTimeout` and `setInterval` can be used in a web application setting.

This project uses `setTimeout` to transition between backgrounds, transition through questions and to add and remove classes at certain times.

This project also uses `setInterval` for the game's timer, which once it hits zero, is an automatic wrong, and will move to the next question.

### How to play :
There are twenty computer-based questions, with four possile answers each. The player has 15 seconds to choose an answer, or the timer will run out, and automatically move to the next question.

Players can choose questions simply by clicking on them, and a the end are presented with a screen that displays the amount of questions they got correct, wrong, and questions that ran out of time.

There is also an option to restart the game, which sets the player back at quesiton one, and resetting all statistics.

### How to install :
This project can be simply installed by cloning the GitHub repo onto your computer, and then opening the `index.html` file.

Alternatively, you can play the game live online [here](https://declanmorrison.github.io/Trivial-Trivia/).
